Finding my purpose has always been important to me, ever since a quote by my childhood hero, the Iron Man, resonated deeply &#8212; **"I shouldn't be alive... unless it was for a reason."**

My name is João Paulo, and at 22, I still have the same spark in my eyes that I had when I first opened a browser game in my mom's old computer. That passion for technology and games led me to Salvador in 2019 to start my academic journey in Computer Engineering at the Federal University of Bahia (UFBA).

Ever since then, I've actively sought opportunities to grow, enhancing my skills and meeting people that could help me to improve my social and professional experience. That's the main reason why I created this blog! To connect with you and share a bit about my experience as an **Aspiring Computer Engineer**.
