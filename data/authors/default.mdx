I'm João Paulo Rios, a Computer Engineering student and aspiring data scientist at the Federal University of Bahia. My passion lies in harnessing the power of machine learning to optimize industrial processes, particularly focusing on improving efficiency and reducing costs.

Beyond academics, I enjoy sharpening my skills in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu or spending quality time with my fiancée and my family. This balance fuels my creativity and helps me approach problems from fresh perspectives.
